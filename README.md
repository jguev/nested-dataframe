## Purpose

This repository was created to help navigate through a nested JSON file and successfully populate a Pandas DataFrame. It introduces an alternative solution to pandas.json_normalize using Jupyter Notebook.

## Prerequisites

&nbsp;&nbsp;:ballot_box_with_check: Python Version: 2.7.16

&nbsp;&nbsp;:ballot_box_with_check: Pandas Version: 1.2.4

&nbsp;&nbsp;:ballot_box_with_check: Jupyter Notebook: 6.1.3

## Dataset

The dataset used in this example spans from March 1, 2019 - March 1, 2021 and consists of 11,522 sessions. 
The JSON file was extracted from [ACN-Data](https://ev.caltech.edu/dataset). 

## Testing

In order to test this repository you will need an environment that supports Jupyter Notebook.

- **Step 1:** Clone project to your local machine
```
git clone https://github.com/jguev/nested-dataframe.git
```

- **Step 2:** Install Jupyter Lab

If you use pip, you can install it with:

```
pip install jupyterlab
```

&nbsp;&nbsp;For additional methods or detailed instructions reference the [installation guide](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html).

- **Step 3:** In order to launch the notebook on your web browser, navigate to the cloned project through your terminal and run the command:

```
jupyter-notebook
```

- **Step 4:** After the notebook opens on your browser, click on the `Nested.ipynb` file


Now you are free to run, edit and test the project using Jupyter-Notebook. Happy coding! :sparkles:
